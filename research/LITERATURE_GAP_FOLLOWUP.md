# Targeted Literature Gap Pass (Follow-Up)

**Experiment:** Inverse Scaling in Activation Steering (follow-up phase)  
**Date started:** 2026-02-18  
**Owner:** Ghost  
**Status:** Not started

---

## Objective

Answer four pre-run questions before any new experiments:

1. Has same-family direction transfer (e.g., 7B -> 14B -> 30/32B) already been done for refusal steering?
2. Has cross-family transfer (Qwen <-> Gemma <-> other families) already been done for refusal directions?
3. Are there published protocols for tooling parity checks in activation extraction pipelines?
4. What evidence exists for universal vs family-specific refusal representations?

---

## Search Protocol

- Time window: 2023-2026 (prefer newest work first)
- Source types: papers + code + technical reports
- Include and evaluate these suggested references:
  1. Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs
  2. Towards universality: studying mechanistic similarity across language model architectures
  3. Activation Space Interventions Can Be Transferred Between Large Language Models

For each source, classify relevance:
- **Directly answers question**
- **Partially relevant**
- **Not relevant / out of scope**
