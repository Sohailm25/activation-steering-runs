# Follow-Up Decision Gate

**Status:** Pending literature-gap completion

## Gate criteria

Proceed to runs only if all are satisfied:

- [ ] Novelty is explicit for at least one track (A or B)
- [ ] Direct duplication risk is low or clearly scoped
- [ ] Minimal experiment design is concrete and falsifiable
- [ ] Budget estimate is within approved range
- [ ] Measurement plan includes reproducibility checks

## Track A Decision: Tooling Reproducibility Study

**Question:** Do we run repeated extraction parity study (NNsight vs raw hooks)?

- Novelty verdict:
- Duplication risk:
- Estimated cost:
- Risk level:
- Recommendation: GO / NO-GO
- Rationale:

## Track B Decision: Direction Transfer Study

### B1 same-family transfer (Qwen 7B -> 14B -> 30/32B)
- Novelty verdict:
- Duplication risk:
- Estimated cost:
- Recommendation: GO / NO-GO
- Rationale:

### B2 cross-family transfer (Qwen <-> Gemma, optional third family)
- Novelty verdict:
- Duplication risk:
- Estimated cost:
- Recommendation: GO / NO-GO
- Rationale:
