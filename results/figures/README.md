# Figures

This directory is a placeholder for generated figures from the analysis.

Figures to generate (from paper):
- Figure 1: Inverse scaling across Qwen and Gemma families
- Figure 2: Layer depth profiles
- Figure 3: DIM vs COSMIC comparison
- Figure 4: Quantization robustness (7B vs 32B)

Scripts to generate these figures can be added based on `final_results.json`.
